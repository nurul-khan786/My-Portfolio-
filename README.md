# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a web-based implementation of the classic two-player game, developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Players take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game features a user-friendly interface, dynamic turn indicators, and a winning logic to determine the result.
